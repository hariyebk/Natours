## Types of relationships between data collections

- 1 to 1
- 1 to many
- few to few , many to many, ton to ton

## The Two types of Data Modles

- Embeding / normalizing 
- Refrencing / Denormalizing

### Types of Refrencing/ Denormalizing

- child refrencing
- parent refrencing 
- two way refrencing

### criterias to choose embeding data model

- for 1 to 1 and 1 to few data relationships
- if the datasets are not queried indepedently
- if the datasets are not updated or written regularly. only read
- if the datasets are strongly correlated.

### criterias to choose referencing data model

- for 1 to many and many to many data relationships
- if the datasets are queried together
- if the datasets are updated or written regularly
- if the datasets are not strongly correlated.

#### The array in the dataset should not grow indefinetly
